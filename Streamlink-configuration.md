The configuration of Streamlink is a mix between parameters set in the Streamlink [config file][config-file] and parameters generated by Streamlink Twitch GUI when launching a stream. Custom parameters can be added in the settings menu instead of adding those to the config file.

Some parameters are hidden/disabled by default, though, and advanced settings need to be enabled first in the main settings menu.


### Streamlink

Streamlink Twitch GUI supports both Streamlink and Livestreamer (plus Livestreamer standalone). Livestreamer support will be dropped in the future, so please switch over to Streamlink if you haven't done yet.

Similar to [[player presets|player-configuration]], Streamlink Twitch GUI includes a list of known installation paths of both Streamlink and Livestreamer. Custom paths need to be set if these applications have been installed in a different location.

Streamlink and Livestreamer require paths for python and the application python script. This is different from Livestreamer standalone (Windows only), where only the executable needs to be selected.


#### Custom parameters

See the Streamlink manual for a [list of all available parameters][streamlink-manual]. Some parameters will be overridden by the GUI.


### Stream type

Streamlink Twitch GUI always uses the [`--player-passthrough`][player-passthrough] Streamlink parameter. This is different from using the Streamlink CLI, where the video data is being passed to the player via `stdin` by default. The reason for this is that some players don't support reading from `stdin`. This parameter also enables seeking in VODs, which is planned to be implemented in the future.

The default passthrough method is `HTTP`, which is supported by most of the video players. `RTMP` is an alternative with less streaming delay (in most cases), but doesn't have the same range of support.

The third option `HLS` works completely different and bypasses Streamlink's internal streaming server. Twitch.tv uses the hls protocol for their streaming infrastructure and when selecting this method, Streamlink will just forward the stream's hls url over to the videoplayer. This method has the shortest delay, but since Streamlink is being bypassed, buffering customizations set in the GUI will be ignored and the player will need to download the stream and needs to be configured instead.

Selecting the `HLS` stream type also changes the behavior of Streamlink. Terminating the Streamlink process won't terminate the player process, which means that the player can't be closed via the GUI anymore (this is a feature of the Streamlink CLI).


### Buffering and stream launch settings

#### HLS live edge + HLS segment threads

These parameters are responsible for the stream fetching and buffering behavior of Streamlink. Please have in mind, that these settings are disabled when choosing the `HLS` stream type (see above).  
See [`--hls-live-edge`][hls-live-edge] and [`--hls-segment-threads`][hls-segment-threads] for more informations.

#### Stream launch attempts

These parameters set Streamlink's behavior in case of stream launch errors.  
See [`--retry-open`][retry-open] and [`--retry-streams`][retry-streams] for more informations.
