This guide describes how to configure Streamlink or Livestreamer.

Please keep in mind that support for Livestreamer will be dropped in the future.


### Selecting a streaming provider

Streamlink Twitch GUI supports both **Streamlink** as well as **Livestreamer**.  
These programs can be [[installed|installation]] in different ways and may require custom configurations, depending on the installation. If installed correctly, Streamlink Twitch GUI is able to automatically select the right configuration and everything will work out of the box.

There are three different streaming provider options:

- **Streamlink** (default)  
  Requires a working python installation that is compatible with Streamlink (the Windows installer for Streamlink already bundles a local python environment).  
  Please make sure that the Streamlink python script (`streamlink-script.py` on Windows, `streamlink` on MacOS/Linux) can be found in the system's `PATH` environment variable. Streamlink Twitch GUI also includes a list of known default locations in case the file could not be resolved. A custom path (relative or absolute) needs to be set if both methods failed, eg. when using a portable python environment.  
  By default, Streamlink Twitch GUI will try to use the python environment Streamlink was built for (set in the [shebang][shebang] of the python script). If this method failed, then it will try to resolve the python executable (`pythonw.exe` on Windows, `python` on MacOS/Linux) by using the `PATH` environment variable and the list of known default locations, like described above.
- **Livestreamer**  
  The Livestreamer equivalent of the Streamlink option. On Windows, this needs to be selected if Livestreamer has been installed via `python-pip`.
- **Livestreamer standalone** (Windows only)  
  Requires Livestreamer to be installed via the Livestreamer Windows installer.  
  Please make sure that the Livestreamer executable (`livestreamer.exe`) can be found in the system's `PATH` environment variable. If it can't be found, Streamlink Twitch GUI will look for this file in a list of known default locations. If Livestreamer has been installed in a different location that can't be automatically resolved, a custom path needs to be set.


### Config file

The configuration of Streamlink/Livestreamer is a mix between parameters set in the Streamlink/Livestreamer [config file][config-file] and parameters generated by Streamlink Twitch GUI when launching a stream.

**Using the config file is not recommended.** All required options and custom parameters can be selected/added in the settings menu of Streamlink Twitch GUI instead of defining those in the config file.

Some parameters are hidden/disabled by default, though, and advanced settings need to be enabled first in the main settings menu.


### Custom parameters

See the Streamlink manual for a [list of all available parameters][streamlink-manual]. Some parameters will be overridden by the GUI.


### Stream type

Streamlink Twitch GUI always uses the [`--player-passthrough`][player-passthrough] Streamlink parameter. This is different from using the Streamlink CLI, where the video data is being passed to the player via `stdin` by default. The reason for this is that some players don't support reading from `stdin`. This parameter also enables seeking in VODs, which is planned to be implemented in the future.

The default passthrough method is `HTTP`, which is supported by most of the video players. `RTMP` is an alternative with less streaming delay (in most cases), but doesn't have the same range of support.

The third option `HLS` works completely different and bypasses Streamlink's internal streaming server. Twitch.tv uses the hls protocol for their streaming infrastructure and when selecting this method, Streamlink will just forward the stream's hls url over to the videoplayer. This method has the shortest delay, but since Streamlink is being bypassed, buffering customizations set in the GUI will be ignored and the player will need to download the stream and needs to be configured instead.

Selecting the `HLS` stream type also changes the behavior of Streamlink. Terminating the Streamlink process won't terminate the player process, which means that the player can't be closed via the GUI anymore (this is a feature of the Streamlink CLI).


### Buffering and stream launch settings

#### HLS live edge + HLS segment threads

These parameters are responsible for the stream fetching and buffering behavior of Streamlink. Please have in mind, that these settings are disabled when choosing the `HLS` stream type (see above).  
See [`--hls-live-edge`][hls-live-edge] and [`--hls-segment-threads`][hls-segment-threads] for more informations.

#### Stream launch attempts

These parameters set Streamlink's behavior in case of stream launch errors.  
See [`--retry-open`][retry-open] and [`--retry-streams`][retry-streams] for more informations.
