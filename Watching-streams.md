After you've set up [[Livestreamer|livestreamer-configuration]] and your [[video player|player-configuration]], you're now finally ready to watch streams.  
Just click on any of the stream preview images, in either of the stream lists, in the featured channels menu or in any of the channel pages. This will open the Livestreamer launch dialog and will validate your Livestreamer configuration and then launch the selected stream in your video player.  
The popup can be closed by clicking the "continue" button and can be reopened again by clicking the preview image or by navigating to the "Watching" menu at the top of application (the TV icon).

### Stream filters

On Twitch you will find streams in a variety of languages. The GUI will display the language and broadcasting language of each channel while hovering the preview image.  
The former may indicate the nationality of a broadcaster while the latter indicates the language of the stream itself. These have been chosen by the broadcaster, so it may not always be correct.  
Go to the settings menu to filter out certain languages. You can choose between two methods:  

**Fade out** (default)  
This will dim out streams not matching your language selection. This is useful if you still want to load all of the streams in a list, but only highlight the ones you're able to understand.

**Filter out**  
This will only load streams matching your language selection. This is useful if you don't care about other streams.  

Streams in the followed streams menu won't be dimmed or filtered.
